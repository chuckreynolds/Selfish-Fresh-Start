This WordPress plugin removes some, in my opinion, unused crappy dashboard, post & page widgets, checks for and nukes Hello Dolly, removes junk header tags, removes update notifications for non-admins, removes old user profile fields like aim, prevents self pining, removes smilies and trackbacks, and a few other settings that nobody needs either. This is built to be very generalized so it'll work with every site as a good clean-up fresh start.

CURRENTLY DOES:
REM wp_head post links, wlm, rsd
REM dashboard widgets
REM post / page metabox redundancies
REM appearance theme editor
REM more jump link to anchor hash
REM update notifications for non-admins
REM self ping backs
REM hello dolly plugin
REM user yim, aim, jabber fields
ADD user twitter, facebook fields 
OFF global trackback setting
OFF global formatting smilies
